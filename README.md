# DemoCoin
This demo project has been made to show my frontend developer capacities. Goal was to develop a small Single Page Application.

## Used tools
* Ionic 5 Framework
* Angular 9

## How to test
To make the project work, you will need to follow those steps:

### Clone repository
```
git clone https://github.com/fefc/demoCoin.git
cd demoCoin
```

### Install packages
```
npm i
```

### Install Ionic CLI
```
npm i -g @ionic/cli
```

### And finally run
```
ionic serve
```

You can now go to https://localhost:8100 and enjoy the little demo.
